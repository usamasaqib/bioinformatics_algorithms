DESCRIPTION
***********
This is an implementation of the Unweighted Pair-Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) algorithm. It is a simple  simple agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering method used to create evolutionary trees for a given set of species. This implementation uses the needleman-wunsch algorithm to calculate the edit distance between different species and uses this to calculate the distance between clusters.
